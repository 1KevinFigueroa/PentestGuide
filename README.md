# PENTEST CHECKLIST GUIDE 
I'm sharing "MY PENTEST GUIDE" collection which offers a wide range presecptive and arsnal of tools to consider when pentesting. Hacking isn't necessarily malicious nor used for defensive purposes. IT IS A WORD. How that word implies to you means different to each individual. For me, hacking first starts by hacking your mind. Remove doubt, disbelieve, and just do it! POINT!

MdY PENTEST MOTTO: LET THESE QUOTES GUIDE YOU!

..* "Winning is not a sometime thing it's an all time thing. You don't win once in a while, you don't do things right once in a while, you do them right all the time. Winning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing." - Vince Lombardi

..* "Preception is a reality, only in your mind!" - Unknown

..* "I never did give them hell. I just told the truth, and they thought it was hell." - Harry S. Truman

Using technologies in some purpose which wasn't intented to be used in that manned. FOR ME, this is the true esence of hacking. Pentesting is a skill, where you never stop learning. This collection is divided into several section based on experience and various research I gathered over the years. Think about how some components may be implemented in your CI/CD pipeline for long term gains and benefits, just a thought!
