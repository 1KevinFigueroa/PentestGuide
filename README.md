# PENTEST CHECKLIST GUIDE 
I'm sharing "MY PENTEST CHECKLIST GUIDE" collection, which offers a wide range of prescriptive and arsenal of tools when considering or conducting a penetration test.

I would like to start off by saying, "Hacking isn't necessarily malicious and offensive, nor is it used for defensive purposes. IT IS A WORD. What that word implies to you may mean something different to another individual. For me, hacking first starts by hacking your mind. Remove doubt, disbelief, and a "just do it" attitude! POINT!"

MY PENTEST MOTTO: LET THESE QUOTES BE INSIGHTFUL TO YOU!

* "Winning is not a sometime thing; it's an all-time thing. You don't win once in a while, you don't do things right once in a while, you do them right all the time. Winning is a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing." - Vince Lombardi

* "Preception is a reality, only in your mind!" - Unknown

* "I never did give them hell. I just told the truth, and they thought it was hell." - Harry S. Truman

Using technologies for purposes unintended is the true essence of hacking for me. Penetration testing is a skill where you never stop learning and evolving. Reading and researching technology is a vital instrument for success when conducting penetration tests. Several elements to be mindful of during pentesting are methodologies, data capture, and reporting. This collection is divided into several sections based on experience and various research I gathered over the years. Consider how some components may be implemented in your CI/CD pipeline for long-term gains and benefits; just a thought.

The following are phases of penetration testing:<br>
1. Scoping and Pre-engagment interaction<br>
2. Intelligence gathering or OSINT<br>
3. Vulnerability analysis<br>
4. Threat Modeling<br>
5. Exploitation<br>
6. Post-exploitation<br>
7. Reporting<br>
